# guess-your-number
A machine learning project to guess your drawn number (0-9) with pytorch, ignite and tkinter

Built with pytorch and ignite, the model guesses the user input number that can be drawn into a tkinter canvas, converted to an
image and then processed as a torch tensor to be forwarded into the model.
